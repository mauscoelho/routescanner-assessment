# RouteScanner â€“ Assessment

## Instructions:
1. `npm install`
2. `npx prisma generate` in case you want to generate the Prisma types

## Notes
I used Prisma with SQLite as the database for this demo. To make it easier to run the project, I included the SQLite database file in the repository. The database file is located at `prisma/dev.db`. Obviously, in a real-world scenario, you would not include the database file in the repository.
